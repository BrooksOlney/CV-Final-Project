    Computer Vision Final Project
    Model reduction techniques for CNNs targeting mobile applications

    Authors:
    Brooks Olney, Peter Stilian

    This is the main script that implements and evaluates the reduction methods.
    Pipeline is as follows:
        1) loaded model and dataset are
        2) compute baseline metrics for accuracy, model size, and performance (time for inference)
        3) perform model reduction technique - pruning or rank factorization
      **4) compute (2) for reduced model
        5) quantize the weights to smaller precision
        6) compute (2) again
        7) plot results

        ** may only compute these metrics once, and compare to baseline for final (post quantization) model
